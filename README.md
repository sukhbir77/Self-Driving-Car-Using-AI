# Self-Driving-Car-Using-AI
A self driving car game developed using AI in python. Developed using Deep Q Learning algorithm.  
The Car and Environment is developed using KIVY Python module.
A simple car Game in which the goal of the car is to reach the bottom right corner and then reach top left corner of the interface.
At the start the car explores the environment and becomes able to complete round trips.
Then we can draw some obstacles in the path of the car using left mouse key.
Then AI learns to avoid these obstacles while performing the round trips.
AI or car gets a positive reward when reaches its goal and gets a negative reward when moves away from the goal or moves onto the obstackle.
